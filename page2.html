<!-- Water in Quran Section -->
<div class="container my-4">
  <h2 class="text-white">Water in Quran</h2>
  <p>The word "water" (ماء) is mentioned in the Quran a total of 63 times. These references highlight the significance of water as a vital element for life, its role in creation, and its spiritual symbolism throughout various verses. Water is often associated with themes of sustenance, purification, and divine mercy, illustrating its importance in both physical and spiritual contexts. Here are the key aspects through which the Quran underscores the significance of water:</p>
  
  <h4 class="text-white">Water as a Source of Life</h4>
  <p>The Quran states that every living thing is created from water, emphasizing its fundamental role in life. Water is not merely a resource but a vital element for existence itself. It is also described as a means through which Allah nourishes the earth and its inhabitants. The Quran notes that rain brings forth vegetation and sustains crops. This highlights water's critical function in agricultural productivity and food security.</p>

  <h4 class="text-white">Water as a Blessing</h4>
  <p>Water is often referred to as a sign of Allah's mercy. The Quran describes rain as "pure water" sent down to revive barren lands, symbolizing hope and renewal. This connection between water and divine grace reinforces its value in both physical and spiritual realms. In the context of Jannat, the Quran promises believers gardens with flowing streams, symbolizing eternal sustenance and bliss. This portrayal of water in Jannat serves to elevate its status as a precious gift from Allah.</p>

  <h4 class="text-white">Water in Ritual Purity</h4>
  <p>Water holds an essential place in Islamic rituals, such as ablution (wudu) before prayers. The Quran emphasizes cleanliness. This ritual use of water underscores its role in maintaining spiritual purity. Water is also seen as a purifying agent for the soul. The Quran mentions "pure water" that Allah sends down to cleanse and rejuvenate both land and spirit. This duality of function—physical cleansing and spiritual renewal—highlights water's multifaceted importance.</p>

  <h4 class="text-white">Water as a Symbol of Divine Power</h4>
  <p>The Quran illustrates Allah's omnipotence by stating that He controls the provision of water. Verses such as "We send down water from the sky in measure" remind believers that while they rely on water for survival, it is ultimately under divine command. The Quran also warns about the destructive potential of water when misused or taken for granted. It recounts stories like that of Prophet Nooh, where excessive water led to punishment for those who rejected divine guidance. This serves as a reminder of the balance between gratitude for blessings and accountability for actions.</p>

  <p>The Quran emphasizes that water is not only essential for physical survival but also serves profound spiritual purposes. It reflects Allah's mercy, sustains life, symbolizes purity, and demonstrates His power over creation. Believers are encouraged to appreciate this vital resource while recognizing their responsibility to use it wisely.</p>
